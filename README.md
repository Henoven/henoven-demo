## About
Henoven is a React web app developed with the purpose of being a platform of monitoring and control of temperature and humidity in refrigerated trucks used for carrying food or medicines. Some of the features that this app has are:

- The user can watch in real time the temperature, location and status of all of his trucks in a user friendly interface (using charts and google maps to present the data).
- Create teams to organize who can edit and see what.
- Generate alarms whenever a truck reaches a dangerous temperature that can spoil the carrying products.
- See all the travels that were made in the past and filtered them by date, name, etc.
- Connect and set new GPS devices (for monitoring location, temperature, humidity, etc) to your account.

The idea is to have a user friendly platform that can help the frozen food and medicine industry to control and save money avoiding deliver spoiled products to their clients.

##Project Development

In order to realize this project we used the follow packages:

-Axios
-Redux
-ApexCharts
-Antd

We also used the google-maps API to show the location of the GPS devices.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
